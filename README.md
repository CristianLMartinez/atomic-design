# Work with SASS (scss)

In this branch we are going to understand a little more about SASS and how to use
it...

First at all, we need to install the needed dependencies to start to configure SASS
and its compilations process, for that we use gulp and write a gulpfile in order
to configure our SASS compilation and SASS files
```sh
  npm install gulp gulp-sass sass --save-dev
```
